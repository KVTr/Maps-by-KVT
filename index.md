# Maps by KVT

This is the primary location for all Minecraft Maps that KVT has contributed to, primarily being CTM Maps.

**CTM Maps & Standard Rules**
<br>
<br>
CTM (Complete the Monument) is a relatively unknown genre of Minecraft Maps that involves the collection of objectives through dungeons that mostly provide an experience enhanced from vanilla survival and more often than not, harder.
<br>

1. Use at least Easy difficulty or higher (Never Peaceful).
2. Do not craft the primary objective blocks for the monument.
3. Do not use in-game commands.
4. Do not leave the boundaries of the map.
5. Use any strategy necessary to obtain the objectives.

Description:
The map features a grand total of 15 dungeons to find wool in and explore! It also has a new layout unlike the past ones. Each area is connected with a natural transition and with actual intersections! (Woah!) So go ahead and tackle it if you dare, although be warned, the map is neither balance tested nor really a full product. It was made in an hour after all. This is... Quickfire: New Beginnings.
