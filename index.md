**CTM Maps & The CTMC**

CTM (Complete the Monument) is a relatively unknown genre of Minecraft Maps that involves the collection of objectives through dungeons that mostly provide an experience enhanced from vanilla survival and more often than not, harder. The CTMC (CTM Community) is a small community of map makers and map players alike formed years ago, currently, they reside on the CTMC Discord Server, where users can discuss the creation of maps, their experiences, videos, and more. Community Events are also common among the CTMC, where events such as Quickfires, 3-Hour Miracles, Strawberry Jams, and larger collaborative mapping events take place.

**Standard Rules of CTM Maps**

1. Use at least Easy difficulty or higher (Never Peaceful).
2. Do not craft the primary objective blocks for the monument.
3. Do not use in-game commands.
4. Do not leave the boundaries of the map.
5. Use any strategy necessary to obtain the objectives.
